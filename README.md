### Colin Harfst Submission

#### To run this project:

- Run `dotnet run --project YankeesChallenge` from the root directory.
- Open https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html.
- Include React info here.

#### Notes:

> Use this space to include some extra info.

- Is .NET Web API really the way to go here when I could use .NET MVC?
- Include some unit test info.
- What are some things I may have done differently if I had loads of extra time?

#### This is a chart (may want to use this for something):

|                        | Endpoint                   | Example        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| `/Player/{id}`         | `GET /Player/{id}`         | `/Player/1234` |
| `/Team/{abbreviation}` | `GET /Team/{abbreviation}` | `/Team/NYY`    |
